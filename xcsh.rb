  # After brew (re)installs the binary, recycle the running manager so the upgrade
  # takes effect immediately: refresh the native-messaging wrapper and ask the old
  # manager to step down (it lingers on the now-replaced binary otherwise). Uses the
  # just-installed binary, so the new version drives it. Best-effort — rescued so a
  # sandboxed or offline post_install can never fail the upgrade; the manager also
  # self-recycles on its next sweep/provision.
  #
  # Likewise stop a running "office serve" holding :8444 on the now-replaced binary,
  # so the next "xcsh office serve" starts clean instead of "port 8444 in use".
